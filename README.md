The datasets are coming from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), OECD, The World Bank, and Our World in Data.

A total of 13 datasets were selected for the purpose of analysis, cleaned, and merged into a single database with 142 countries and 20 features from 2010 to 2020.

## Fighting malnutrition through improved worldwide food redistribution of unsold vegetables

*Malnutrition is one of the world's greatest public health challenges, affecting millions of people each year, particularly in developing countries. At the same time, large quantities of vegetables are often wasted or unsold in developed countries due to overproduction and strict aesthetic standards.*

*However, exporting these unsold vegetables to countries that are in short supply could help alleviate the malnutrition crisis by providing nutritious food to those who need it most. The market research analysis will follow these steps:*

+ *First we'll define the topic of global malnutrition and its effects on the health of affected populations using NLP*
+ *Then we'll explore the various country clusters for unsold vegetable export to identify opportunities for action against malnutrition and for reducing food waste, to do so we'll also take into account the logistical, economic and regulatory challenges associated with this approach*
+ *Finally, based on the results of our analysis, we'll put forward recommendations for target countries, additionnally a 2010-2020 projection will be proposed to visualize the stability of the clusters over time*
