## Fighting malnutrition through improved worldwide food redistribution of unsold vegetables

*Malnutrition is one of the world's greatest public health challenges, affecting millions of people each year, particularly in developing countries. At the same time, large quantities of vegetables are often wasted or unsold in developed countries due to overproduction and strict aesthetic standards.*

*However, exporting these unsold vegetables to countries that are in short supply could help alleviate the malnutrition crisis by providing nutritious food to those who need it most. The market research analysis will follow these steps:*

+ *first we will define the topic of global malnutrition and its effects on the health of affected populations using NLP*
+ *then we will explore the various country clusters for unsold vegetable export to identify opportunities for action against malnutrition and for reducing food waste, to do so we will also take into account the logistical, economic and regulatory challenges associated with this approach*
+ *finally based on the results of our analysis, we will propose recommendations for target countries for the exportation of unsold vegetables in the context of the fight against malnutrition. A 2010-2020 projection will also be proposed to visualize the stability of the clusters over time*
